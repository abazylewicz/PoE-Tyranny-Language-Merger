# PoE/Tyranny Language Merger
## What works

* Merging conversation text
* Merging quest description text
* Merging some gameUI text
* Pillars of Eternity and Tyranny

## How to

1. Download latest release.zip and unzip.
2. Run textmerger.exe
3. Enter the folder that the game .exe is located in (e.g for me it's C:\GOG Games\Tyranny). Use the ... button or just paste and press enter.
4. Wait until it finds the languages.
5. Choose the primary language and the secondary language. The primary language will be the main language of the game.
6. Check the checkboxes you want to merge.
7. Press 'Merge' and wait until it says it's done.
8. In-game change the language to PrimaryLanguage/SecondaryLanguage (e.g English/French)

This doesn't delete or replace the original languages but creates a new merged one.
