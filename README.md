## How to

1. Use ... to locate game folder (where Tyranny.exe or PillarsOfEternity.exe is located)
2. Choose the primary language on the left, which will be the language of the UI and the quests.
3. Choose the secondary language on the right, which will be next to the primary language (conversations only right now)
4. Press merge and wait.
5. In game the new language should be shown as PrimaryLanguage/SecondaryLanguage (e.g English/French)
